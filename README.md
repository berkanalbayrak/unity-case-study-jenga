# Educational Jenga Game - Unity Project (Case Study)

Welcome to my Unity case study project, a fusion of educational objectives with interactive gaming across all subjects. This project aims to assist students in solidifying their foundational knowledge through a 3D Jenga-style representation.
## Project Overview

This case study addresses the challenge of foundational education by visualizing core concepts from various subjects as blocks within a virtual Jenga tower. This innovative method enables students to identify learning gaps and focus on essential areas in an engaging and interactive setup.

### Development Time
This project was diligently completed over a span of 10 hours, reflecting committed efforts in design, development, and testing to ensure the creation of a good project.

### Features
- **Grade-Level Stacks**: Constructed based on API data, representing different grade levels and subjects.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Incorporates orbit controls for a full engagement and exploration experience.
- **"Test My Stack" Mode**: Demonstrates the critical importance of a strong foundation in diverse educational topics.
